## PyRAM

-----

Python adaptation of the Range-dependent Acoustic Model (RAM).

RAM was created by Michael D Collins at the US Naval Research Laboratory.
This adaptation is of RAM v1.5, available from the Ocean Acoustics Library at
https://oalib-acoustics.org/models-and-software/parabolic-equation

The purpose of PyRAM is to provide a version of RAM which can be used within a
Python interpreter environment (e.g. Spyder or the Jupyter notebook) and is
easier to understand, extend and integrate into other applications than the
Fortran version. It is written in pure Python and achieves speeds comparable to
native code by using the Numba library for JIT compilation.

The PyRAM class contains methods which largely correspond to the original
Fortran subroutines and functions (including retaining the same names). The
variable names are also mostly the same. However some of the original code,
e.g. subroutine zread, is unnecessary when the same purpose can be achieved
using widely available Python library functions, e.g. from NumPy or SciPy,
and has therefore been replaced.

A difference in functionality is that sound speed profile updates with range
are decoupled from seabed parameter updates, which provides more flexibility
in specifying the environment, e.g. if the data comes from different sources.

PyRAM also provides various conveniences, e.g. automatic calculation of range
and depth steps, though these can be overridden using keyword arguments.
